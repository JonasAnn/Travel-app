# Time to Travel 

## Project Five - Travel App (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)
#### What I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript (Vanilla)

### Project Objective
To build a travel application that contains a simple form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date. This is project #5 - part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.

### Building
To build I followed the following steps, creating: 

* Workflow to break project in small steps
* Wireframe of the website on https://mockflow.com
* Got my basic project setup and functioning in Visual Studio Code (HTML, installed SASS, wrote styles and set up a local server)
* Installed and configured Webpack (+ essential loaders and plugins)
* Set up async requests to fetch destination image and weather, based on user input, obtained from when the form is submitted by the user
* Refactored code, installed plugins to minify CSS and ran testing with JEST
