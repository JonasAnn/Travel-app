# Time to Travel 

## Project Five - Travel App (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)
#### What I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript (Vanilla)

### Project Objective
To build a travel application that contains a simple form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date. This is project #5 - part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.

### Building
To build I followed the following steps, creating: 

* Workflow to break project in small steps
* Wireframe of the website on https://mockflow.com
* Got my basic project setup and functioning in Visual Studio Code (HTML, installed SASS, wrote styles and set up a local server)
* Installed and configured Webpack (+ essential loaders and plugins)
* Set up async requests to fetch destination image and weather, based on user input, obtained from when the form is submitted by the user
* Refactored code, installed plugins to minify CSS and ran testing with JEST 

### Project Dependencies

The ‘cors’ package should be installed in the project from the command line, required in the project file server.js, and the instance of the app should be setup to use cors().+

The body-parser package should be installed and included in the project.
